Central (``central_function``)
-----------------
The central part is responsible for the orchestration and aggregation of the algorithm.

.. Describe the central function here.

Partials
--------
Partials are the computations that are executed on each node. The partials have access
to the data that is stored on the node. The partials are executed in parallel on each
node.
